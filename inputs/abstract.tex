A bar visibilty representation of a planar graph $G$ is a drawing of $G$ where each vertex is drawn as a horizontal line segment called bars, each edge is drawn as a vertical line segment where the vertical line segment representing an edge must connect the horizontal line segments representing the end vertices. In a bar k-visibility representation of a graph $G$, a horizontal line corresponds to a vertex called a bar and a vertical line segment corresponding to an edge intersects at most $k$ bars which are not end points of the edge. Thus a bar visibility representation is a bar k-visibility representation for $k = 0$. For $k = 1$, a line segment corresponding to an edge intersects at most one bar which is not an end point of the edge and the representation is called a bar 1-visibility representation. A graph is a bar 1-visibility graph if it admits a bar 1-visibility representation. Similarly, For $k = 2$, a line segment corresponding to an edge intersects at most two bar which is not an end point of the edge and the representation is called a bar 2-visibility representation. A graph is a bar 2-visibility graph if it admits a bar 2-visibility representation.

In this thesis, we study bar 2-visibility Graphs. We give a linear-time algorithm for 2-visibility representation of an embedded 2-planar graph. Since, every 2-planar graph is bar 2-visible and both 2-visible and 2-planar graphs of size $n$ have at most $5n-10$ edges.
